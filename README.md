# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm James Flores, an Air Force veteran, programmer, and cyber security enthusiast. I've worked in the cyber world since 2015, from help desk to being a system administrator to analyzing malware. Proficient in PowerShell and Python, intermediate in Java and JavaScript, and still learning C and C++. I enjoy watching movies, card magic (still learning), and of course gaming.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: contact@jamesflores.dev
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born on mother's day and was even on the news (according to my mom).
