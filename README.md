# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm an Air Force veteran, programmer, and Systems Engineer. I have been working with computers since 2009 and have been coding since 2012. I've had a lot of jobs, all the way from Technician to Malware Analyst.

Most of my coding is done in PowerShell but I'm also proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Java. Currently working towards my B.S. in Cloud Computing and have three certifications (CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Linux+, and GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst).
